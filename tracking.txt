2.50	12/23 - Put together basis of framework; building widgets into meshes and caching them; etc.
2.00	12/24 - TileSheet spec and implementation; compiling used textures into a single atlas; text string mesh building.
				- Notes: Didn't implement the color encoding scheme from DwarfCorp. Need to see how this is used before implementing.
4.00	12/25 - Wrote simple dialog test; checkbox; backported to XNA; Keyboard handling in GUI; Keyboard hook for demo -
				- Notes: Existing keyboard handling in DwarfCorp appears to use XNA's KeyBoardState and will drop keyevents
				with impaired framerate. It is also using some kind of massive switch for handling shift?? This should be
				replaced.
0.75	12/26 - Ditched property implementation (Inheritance was only appropriate for 2 properties anyway)
1.00			Vertical Scrollbar rendering.
1.00			Vertical Scrollbar click logic.
2.00			ListView control - scrollbar, list of items, rendering properly.
				Rewrote layout system. Slightly better; widgets are starting to feel more bloated. Have to remember that extra work
				at construction time is no big deal, as long as they remain lean on runtime logic.
0.50			ListView OnClick handler - select items in the list.
0.50	12/27 - Combo box behavior
				- Notes: Need a 'popup' style widget to handle automatically closing the combo box pulldown when the screen is 
				clicked somewhere else.
1.50			Ported to monogame
